Market Making Library

A Rust library implementing quantitative market making strategies, starting with the
Avellaneda-Stoikov model. This library provides the mathematical foundations and domain models
necessary for building automated market making systems for financial markets.

## Overview

Market making is the practice of simultaneously providing buy (bid) and sell (ask) quotes
in a financial market. The market maker profits from the bid-ask spread while providing
liquidity to the market.

### Key Challenges

- **Inventory Risk**: Holding positions exposes the market maker to price movements
- **Adverse Selection**: Informed traders may trade against you when they have better information
- **Optimal Pricing**: Balance between execution probability and profitability

## The Avellaneda-Stoikov Model

The Avellaneda-Stoikov model (2008) solves the optimal market making problem using
stochastic control theory. It determines optimal bid and ask prices given:

- Current market price and volatility
- Current inventory position
- Risk aversion
- Time remaining in trading session
- Order arrival dynamics

## Modules

- [`strategy`]: Pure mathematical calculations for quote generation
- [`position`]: Inventory tracking and PnL management
- [`market_state`]: Market data representation
- [`risk`]: Position limits, exposure control, and circuit breakers
- [`analytics`]: Market data analysis and order flow metrics
- [`types`]: Common types and error definitions
- [`prelude`]: Convenient re-exports of commonly used types

## Quick Start

Import commonly used types with the prelude:

```rust
use market_maker_rs::prelude::*;
```

## Examples

Examples will be added once core functionality is implemented.

## 🛠 Makefile Commands

This project includes a `Makefile` with common tasks to simplify development. Here's a list of useful commands:

### 🔧 Build & Run

```sh
make build         # Compile the project
make release       # Build in release mode
make run           # Run the main binary
```

### 🧪 Test & Quality

```sh
make test          # Run all tests
make fmt           # Format code
make fmt-check     # Check formatting without applying
make lint          # Run clippy with warnings as errors
make lint-fix      # Auto-fix lint issues
make fix           # Auto-fix Rust compiler suggestions
make check         # Run fmt-check + lint + test
```

### 📦 Packaging & Docs

```sh
make doc           # Check for missing docs via clippy
make doc-open      # Build and open Rust documentation
make create-doc    # Generate internal docs
make readme        # Regenerate README using cargo-readme
make publish       # Prepare and publish crate to crates.io
```

### 📈 Coverage & Benchmarks

```sh
make coverage            # Generate code coverage report (XML)
make coverage-html       # Generate HTML coverage report
make open-coverage       # Open HTML report
make bench               # Run benchmarks using Criterion
make bench-show          # Open benchmark report
make bench-save          # Save benchmark history snapshot
make bench-compare       # Compare benchmark runs
make bench-json          # Output benchmarks in JSON
make bench-clean         # Remove benchmark data
```

### 🧪 Git & Workflow Helpers

```sh
make git-log             # Show commits on current branch vs main
make check-spanish       # Check for Spanish words in code
make zip                 # Create zip without target/ and temp files
make tree                # Visualize project tree (excludes common clutter)
```

### 🤖 GitHub Actions (via act)

```sh
make workflow-build      # Simulate build workflow
make workflow-lint       # Simulate lint workflow
make workflow-test       # Simulate test workflow
make workflow-coverage   # Simulate coverage workflow
make workflow            # Run all workflows
```

ℹ️ Requires act for local workflow simulation and cargo-tarpaulin for coverage.
